# Finance Calculator

This Python script serves as a simple finance calculator that allows users to calculate the interest earned on an investment or the amount to be paid on a home loan (bond). It provides options to calculate either investment or bond based on user input.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python finance_calculator.py
```

2. The script will display the main header "Finance Calculator" and present the user with two options:

   - "Investment" - To calculate the amount of interest earned on an investment.
   - "Bond" - To calculate the amount to be paid on a home loan.

3. After choosing an option, the user will be prompted to provide additional details based on their selection:

   - For "Investment," the user needs to input the deposit amount, interest rate (as an integer excluding %), investment duration in years, and choose between simple or compound interest.
   - For "Bond," the user needs to input the present value of the house, interest rate (as an integer excluding %), and the bond duration in months.

4. The script will then calculate and display the desired output:

   - For "Investment," it will show the total investment amount after the specified duration.
   - For "Bond," it will show the total amount to be paid on the home loan.

## Note

- For investment calculations, the script offers options for both simple and compound interest.
- The interest rate should be provided as an integer value, excluding the percentage symbol (%).
- The bond duration should be provided in months.
